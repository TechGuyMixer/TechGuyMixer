---> Howdy, sup hey and hi I'm the TechGuyMixer...
I am interested in preservation of the good and kind and try to rewind  where the evil ones are that I find...
I am currently learning policy and certificate powers hidden from the blind eyes.
I am currently looking to collaborate on ending lowlifes who prey on the weak, the kind fueled by street drugs addiction and popularity. They use grey areas in networks and technology to enable the consistence success of said bullies
for unknown reasons (clout?). (No actions just smelling out the trail)
How to reach me. Cake in the front of the message with message preferance, if you need help I feel bad for you son I got nothing.
